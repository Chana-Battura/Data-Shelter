# Data-Shelter

## Inspiration
During Quarantine, many people adopted animals with the newfound time, me included. However, as quarantine is coming to an end, some people realizing that they cannot take care of them, have started to relinquish them.  This inspired me to raise awareness about this with **Data Shelter** with the depth of shelter data.

## What it does
Data Shelter takes data from the National Shelter Database and compiles the data in an easy visual format, allowing users to tinker around with the information.  With the various statistics, I hope that people start to see the rising trends and are more aware of shelter capacities.

## How I built it
I built this project using python and a special data visualization library called Dash and plotly.  With these libraries, I was able to deploy a flask application that shows aesthetic and understandable graphs.

## Challenges we ran into
I ran into challenges with the formating of the app, as I am not too familiar with HTML but was able to push through

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud of the design of the app as it seems professional and truly achieves its goal

## What's next for Data Shelter
The National Data Shelter actually has more extensive data, but is hidden behind a paywall, which maybe later can be added to Data Shelter
